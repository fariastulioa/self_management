expedient_calc  - Tool for easier management of work hours and schedule. Consists of a GUI/Desktop app that gets as input from the user: 1 - arriving time (beginning of the workday), 2 - lunch time and 3 - hours to work today (how much time one plans to work on that particular day). Using these inputs, the app calculates the return time (the time at which the user should be arriving from lunch) and the leaving time (the moment the user should be wrapping up and going home). Besides showing the output times in LCD-like displays, this tool also works as an alarm clock (playing a sound and generating popups) for when the user should clocking in/clocking out of work.
